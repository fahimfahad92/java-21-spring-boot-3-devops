## Overview

This project demonstrates DevOps practices and Docker optimization techniques for a Spring Boot 3.5.4 application running on Java 21. It serves as a research and development project to explore various containerization approaches and their impact on final image size.

The application provides simple REST API endpoints for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Technologies Used

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.5.4
- Maven
- Docker
- BellSoft Liberica JDK/JRE
- Eclipse Temurin JDK/JRE

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 or later
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker

## Setup and Installation

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository: 
    ```
   git clone https://github.com/fahimfahad92/java-21-spring-boot-3-devops.git
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean package
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Docker Deployment

The project includes multiple Dockerfiles demonstrating different approaches to containerization:

1. Single-stage build with Eclipse Temurin:
   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile-eclipse-temurin-single-stage -t spring-app:temurin-single .
   ```

2. Multi-stage build with Eclipse Temurin:
   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile-eclipse-temurin-multi-stage -t spring-app:temurin-multi .
   ```

3. Single-stage build with BellSoft Liberica:
   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile-liberica-single-stage -t spring-app:liberica-single .
   ```

4. Multi-stage build with BellSoft Liberica (the smallest image):
   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile-liberica-multi-stage -t spring-app:liberica-multi .
   ```

5. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-app:liberica-multi
   ```

## API Endpoints

The application exposes two simple REST endpoints:

1. **GET /ping**
   - Returns: `{"message": "pong at [current timestamp]"}`
   - Purpose: Simple health check endpoint

2. **GET /welcome**
   - Returns: `{"message": "Welcome to Spring Boot 3.5 at [current timestamp]"}`
   - Purpose: Welcome message endpoint

## Docker Optimization Results

This project explores different Docker base images and build strategies to optimize the final container size. The table below shows the comparison of different approaches:

| Image Name | Base Image | Build Strategy | Final Image Size | After using docker slim | Notes |
|------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| eclipse-temurin | 21-jdk-alpine | Single-stage | 738.76 MB | 299.32 MB | Largest image size, includes full JDK |
| eclipse-temurin | 21-jdk-alpine (build)<br>21-jre-alpine (runtime) | Multi-stage | 321.53 MB | 239.79 MB | 56% smaller than single-stage |
| bellsoft/liberica-runtime-container | jdk-21-musl | Single-stage | 387.25 MB | 198.58 MB | Smaller than Temurin single-stage |
| bellsoft/liberica-runtime-container | jdk-21-musl (build)<br>jre-21-slim-musl (runtime) | Multi-stage | 219.98 MB | 214.37MB | Smallest image, 70% reduction from largest |

### Key Optimization Techniques

1. **Multi-stage builds**: Separating the build environment from the runtime environment
2. **JRE instead of JDK**: Using smaller JRE images for runtime
3. **Layer optimization**: Extracting and organizing application into layers
4. **Alpine/Musl-based images**: Using lightweight base images
5. **Cleanup**: Removing unnecessary build artifacts and cache
6. **Docker slim**: Using docker slim can reduce image size significantly, but it requires caution

## CRaC for Spring Boot Application

### What is CRaC?

CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) is a technology that significantly reduces application startup time by creating a checkpoint of a running application and later restoring it from that checkpoint. This is particularly beneficial for Java applications, which traditionally have longer startup times compared to other technologies.

### Benefits of CRaC

- **Dramatically reduced startup times**: Applications can start in milliseconds instead of seconds or minutes
- **Warm application state**: The application is restored with a warm state, including initialized caches and connections
- **Lower resource usage during startup**: Less CPU and memory consumption during the restore phase
- **Improved user experience**: Faster application availability after deployment or scaling events

### Implementation Requirements

To use CRaC with Spring Boot, you need:

1. Add the CRaC dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.crac</groupId>
    <artifactId>crac</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Use a JDK/JRE that supports CRaC (like BellSoft Liberica JDK/JRE with CRaC support)
3. Configure your application to create checkpoints at appropriate times

### Using CRaC with Docker

This project includes a specialized Dockerfile (`Dockerfile-liberica-crac`) that sets up the environment for CRaC. The following steps demonstrate how to build, checkpoint, and restore the application:

```bash
# Step 1: Build the Docker image with CRaC support
docker build . -t demo-app-crac -f Dockerfile-liberica-crac

# Step 2: Run the container with required capabilities
# This will start the application and create a checkpoint
docker run --cap-add CHECKPOINT_RESTORE --cap-add SYS_PTRACE --name demo-app-crac demo-app-crac

# Step 3: Create a new image from the container with the checkpoint
# This image will be configured to restore from the checkpoint on startup
docker commit --change='ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-XX:CRaCRestoreFrom=/checkpoint"]' demo-app-crac demo-app-crac-restore

# Step 4: Remove the original container
docker rm -f demo-app-crac

# Step 5: Run the application from the checkpoint
# Notice how quickly the application starts up!
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 --cap-add CHECKPOINT_RESTORE --cap-add SYS_PTRACE --name demo-app-crac --entrypoint java demo-app-crac-restore -XX:CRaCRestoreFrom=/checkpoint
```

## CDS for Spring Boot Application

### What is Class Data Sharing (CDS)?

Class Data Sharing (CDS) is a JVM feature that improves startup time and reduces memory footprint by:
- Pre-processing and storing class metadata in an archive file
- Sharing this metadata across multiple JVM instances
- Reducing the time needed for class loading during application startup

CDS is particularly beneficial for containerized Spring Boot applications, as it can significantly reduce startup times in environments where quick scaling is important.

### Prerequisites

1. Enable AOT (Ahead-of-Time) processing in pom.xml:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>process-aot</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>process-aot</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

2. Use a JDK/JRE that supports CDS (like BellSoft Liberica JDK/JRE with CDS support)

### Using CDS with Docker

This project includes a specialized Dockerfile (`Dockerfile-liberica-cds`) that sets up the environment for CDS. The key components of this Dockerfile are:

1. Using BellSoft Liberica JRE with CDS support
2. Creating a CDS archive during container build with:
   ```
   java -XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit=./application.jsa -Dspring.context.exit=onRefresh -jar app.jar
   ```
3. Configuring the application to use the CDS archive at startup with:
   ```
   -XX:SharedArchiveFile=application.jsa
   ```

### Building and Running with CDS

```bash
# Step 1: Build the Docker image with CDS support
docker build . -t demo-app-liberica-cds -f Dockerfile-liberica-cds

# Step 2: Run the container
# Notice the improved startup time compared to non-CDS containers
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name demo demo-app-liberica-cds
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows to automate container builds, image publishing to Amazon ECR, and deployments to Amazon ECS. All workflows currently run on push events to the master branch. They use GitHub OIDC to assume AWS IAM roles without storing longâ€‘lived AWS credentials.

- Push to ECR (.github/workflows/ci-dev.yml)
  - Trigger: push on master
  - Purpose: Build the Docker image and push demo-app:latest to Amazon ECR
  - Key steps:
    - actions/checkout@v4
    - aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4 (assume role arn:aws:iam::568560058349:role/GHA-ECR-PUSH; region ap-southeast-1)
    - aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2
    - docker build -f Dockerfile-liberica-multi-stage -t demo-app:latest .
    - docker tag and docker push to <account>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/demo-app:latest

- Push to ECR with cache (.github/workflows/ci-cache-dev.yml)
  - Trigger: push on master
  - Purpose: Same as above but optimized with Docker Buildx and a persistent cache to speed up subsequent builds
  - Key steps:
    - actions/checkout@v4
    - aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4 (role: GHA-ECR-PUSH)
    - aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2
    - docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
    - actions/cache@v4 for /tmp/.buildx-cache
    - docker/build-push-action@v6 with cache-from/cache-to, load: true, tags: <ECR_REGISTRY>/demo-app:latest
    - docker push

- Deploy to ECS (.github/workflows/ci-deploy-to-ecs-dev.yml)
  - Trigger: push on master
  - Purpose: Build and push the image, then trigger a new deployment on Amazon ECS
  - Environment variables:
    - AWS_REGION: ap-southeast-1
    - ECR_REPO: demo-app
    - ECS_CLUSTER: demo-app-cluster
    - ECS_SERVICE: demo-app-service
    - DOCKER_FILE: Dockerfile-liberica-multi-stage
    - IAM_ROLE: arn:aws:iam::568560058349:role/GH-ECS-DEPLOY
  - Key steps:
    - actions/checkout@v4
    - aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4 (assume IAM_ROLE via OIDC)
    - aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2
    - docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 + actions/cache@v4 for layer caching
    - docker/build-push-action@v6 (build) and docker push to ECR
    - aws ecs update-service --cluster $ECS_CLUSTER --service $ECS_SERVICE --force-new-deployment

Notes and prerequisites
- AWS: The referenced IAM roles (GHA-ECR-PUSH and GH-ECS-DEPLOY) must exist with permissions to push to ECR and deploy to ECS respectively.
- ECR repository: demo-app must exist in the target AWS account/region.
- ECS: demo-app-cluster and demo-app-service should already be provisioned; the service must reference the ECR image demo-app:latest.
- Dockerfile: All workflows build using Dockerfile-liberica-multi-stage by default.
- Manual runs: These workflows are configured for push events. If you want manual triggers, add a workflow_dispatch block to the respective YAML files.
